Implementation of Insertion-sort using C & analyzing algorithm's complexity in diffirent cases using mathematicals formulas including sequances and calculus.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org : Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages.
